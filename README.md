# RubbingGAN
RubbingGAN - Pytorch Implementation 
# Introduction
This is the implementation of the paper "End-to-End Rubbing Restoration Using Generative Adversarial Network. Our goal is to restore the imcomplete calligraphy characters on the traidional Chinese stone inscriptions (Rubbings).
We collect the dataset of ZhangMenglongBei, which used for rubbing restoration.
We have the following datasets: 
<Br/>
路Training Dataset.
<Br/>
路Testing Dataset.
<Br/>
路Incomplete Dataset.
